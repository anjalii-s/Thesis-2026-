        "While hypothesis that \"structured explanations (Owen) should outperform independent explanations (SHAP) when features form meaningful groups\" is theoretically sound, empirical evidence from the LC_50K dataset shows SHAP provides superior interpretability. This suggests that for this particular credit dataset, features don't exhibit strong enough group structure to benefit from Owen's hierarchical approach. The finding highlights the importance of validating explanation methods on specific datasets rather than assuming universal superiority."
